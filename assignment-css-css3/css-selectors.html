Question 1: What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors.

css selectors are used to find or select the html elements you want to styl. there are 5 categories of css slectors
1. element selectors 
2. Descendant selecotors
3. class selectors 
4. id selectors 
5. child selectors 
6. adjacent sibling selectors
7. pseudo selectors 
8. universal selectors 
element selectors : it selects all elements with the specified element name. eg h1, p

class selectors : it is formatted as a period(.) character followed by the name of the class.it selects all elements with that class attribute so that unique css declarations can be applied to those specific elements without affecting other elements on the page. 

ID selectors : the id selector uses the id attribute of an html element to select a specific element. id is uniqe within a page so the id selector is used to select one unique element. to select element with a specific id, #is used followed by id name. 

• Question 2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesget
resolved?

if there are 2 or more css rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity will win and its style declaration will be applied to that html element. the conflict between multiple styles get resolved by seeing the priority list ie. inline will have highest priority, then id selectors, then is class and pseudo class, then will be attributes and the lowest will be elements and pseudo elements. 

• Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

inline css -- it is given in the same line where the tag is used or the class or id is mentioned. it has the highest priority, but the same style will have to be reapeted if needed for some tags again.   
internal css -- it is given in the same file but in the head tag using style tag. can be used in the same file, the same style sheet cannot be used for another file.  
external css -- it is another file with .css extension and link tag is used to link it to the main file in head section. it requires space, but the same style sheet can be used multiple times.
